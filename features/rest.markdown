title: Slick's REST Api
---

Because of slick's [history](/about.html), it's important to have a documented REST Api.  After you setup slick,
the documentation is included!  We use something called [swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) to
document the api.  Because of the way we implemented it, it's live documentation.  That means that as we add or
change the api, the documentation is updated.  You always have the information you need to access slick and the
data in it.  That's important.

Want to see what we are talking about?  Well we have a static version (warning it might be *out of date*) here on the
website.  [Look at the api documentation here](/apidocs.html).
