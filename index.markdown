What is slick?
--------------

Slick is a web app that helps you organize your testing infrastructure.  That means slick does what most test or quality
management applications do.  It keeps track of test cases, projects, results of tests, etc.  One of the main goals
of slick is to make it really easy for engineers and analysts to do their jobs.  Slick's goal is to look nice, give
management what they need, and get out of the way for those using it.

What can it do?
---------------

A short feature list is:
* Various ways to categorize tests, including by project, component, feature, and arbitrary tags.
* Test automation integration without a predefined test tool!  You can use whatever you want
* Documented REST Api
* Put test into testplans to define what should be run, and how it should be run
* Lots of "Manager Porn" or graphs, trends, and debugging information
